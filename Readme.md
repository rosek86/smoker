# Smoker Controller

This project implements simple smoker two relay outputs (smoke and heater). Project is based on the esp8266 nodemcu with integrated OLED 96" display.

OLED display together with encoder is used to create user interface which can be used to define multi-stage smoker program (temperature + smoke on/off).

Temperature is regulated based on the NTC temperature sensor.

Project implemented for my dad. User interface in Polish only.
